| API       | An API allows different applications to communicate with each other. In Express, APIs are used to handle requests from users and send responses back to them.  |
| Backend       | The backend is the part of a web application that runs on a server. It processes user requests, connects to databases, and sends responses. Express is a tool used to build backend applications. |
| Middleware    | Middleware is a function that runs between a request being received and the response being sent. It can be used for tasks like checking user authentication, logging activity, or handling errors. |
| Routing    | Routing is how Express determines what should happen when a user visits a specific URL. |
| Static Files    | Static files are files like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript that donâ€™t change and are sent directly to the user. Express can serve these files using `express.static("public")`. |
| Dynamic Files    | Dynamic files are files that change based on user input or other variables. These are often generated using a view engine like EJS or Pug, allowing for content updates without reloading the entire page. |
| EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)    | EJS is a templating engine that lets you embed JavaScript into HTML. It allows dynamic content rendering using `<%= variable %>` syntax. |
| Status Codes    | Status codes are numbers in HTTP responses that indicate whether a request was successful or not. |
| Error Handling    | Error handling is the process of catching and responding to errors in an Express app. A common way to handle errors is using middleware.
| Server    | A computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client |
| Environment Variables | Environment variables are used to configure settings for different environments (e.g., development, production). They can be set in a `.env` file and loaded using the `dotenv` package. |
| Deployment | Deployment is the process of making an application available for use on a server. This can involve uploading code to a hosting service like Render, Heroku, or AWS. |
| Node.js | Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. |
| Package Manager | A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and managing software packages. npm (Node Package Manager) is commonly used with Node.js. |
| Version Control | Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a popular version control system. |
| Repository | A repository is a storage location for software packages or code. It can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. |
